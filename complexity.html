            <p>
                The Algorithm currently works for proofs in which
                the number of lines can be upto 1000 and individual propositions
                in each line can have a parse tree of maximum height 15.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hence in it should work for all general proofs.
            </p>
            <p>
                The limitations mentioned here can be overcome by making
                minor changes to the code( so that it can work for more than 1000
                lines of proof as well as more levels on each line). But it is
                worth noting that beyond a point the local system's memory capacity
                may not be sufficient to handle increasingly longer proofs.
