            <h1>Space Complexity</h1>
            <p>
                In the program code, we have used a 2-Dimensional char array
                which has 1000 rows and 100005 columns. We have also used
                3 more arrays and 3 stacks. But they are over shadowed
                by the relatively large sized 2-Dimensional array.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, each character takes 1 byte of memory.
                Hence the space complexity is around 10^8 bytes(~100MB) which
                is constant.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Therefore space complexity is O(1).</b>
            </p>
